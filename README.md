# bds-project: #CoronaHoax
Project for the course "Big Data Science".

The demo application is found in the /demo folder. Explanation on what is done in the demo is provided in the notebook.
There is however, one remark: in the "Classification of denialist tweets" section, the num_tweets parameter is set to 10.
This is to improve the time it takes to run the application, but therefore much of the accuracy is lost. For better accuracy, please increase this parameter by at least an order 10.
For the trending hashtags based on location, feel free to adjust the city, country and radius parameters.
